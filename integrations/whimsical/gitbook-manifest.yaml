    # Overview

    Bring the power & beauty of visual communication to your GitBook docs. Embed your Whimsical wireframes, flowcharts, mind maps - and more!

    # How it works

    Embedding Whimsical files into GitBook is simple - just paste a Whimsical link into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into an embed that shows the Whimsical file.

    Make sure that your files have permissions set to `Anyone with a link -> Can View` at least in order for your files to be viewable publically.
